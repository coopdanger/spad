Abstract

   This specification defines a simple JSON format and well known URL
   for firewalls and other devices to discover whats IP addresses,
   ports, and related transports a given cloud services uses.

1.  Introduction

   Simple Port and Address Discovery (SPAD) allows an web application to
   inform others of what ports and IP addresses it uses so that things
   like firewalls can correctly re-configure themsleves as the ports and
   addresses change.  Applications are identified by a domain name which
   is used to form a URL in a well known location where a client can do
   a HTTP REST call to get a JSON file that describes information about
   what addresses and transport the service uses.

2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
   NOT", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant
   implementations.

   RAML is defined at <https://github.com/raml-org>.

   JSON Schema is defined at <http://json-schema.org/>.  Further
   information is available in [I-D.wright-json-schema].

3.  Example

   To figure out what IP addresses are used by the service example.com,
   the first step is to form the query URL by constructing an endpoint
   at ".well-known/spad/v0/spad".

   Then an HTTPS GET query is done that to that URL.

             curl https://example.com/.well-known/spad/v0/spad

Internet-Draft                    SPAD                     November 2016


   The responses would be a JSON result that could looks like

            {
              "domain": "example.com",
              "services": [
                {
                  "name": "example-service",
                  "validTill": "Fri 11 Nov 2016 22:20:08 UTC",
                  "flows": [
                    {
                      "ips": [
                        "203.0.113.2"
                      ],
                      "port": 443,
                      "protocol": "https"
                    }
                  ]
                }
              ]
            }

   The example above indicates that the "example.com" application has a
   single service with a single flow that uses only the HTTPS to connect
   to port 443 on the IP address "203.0.113.2".  This SPAD information
   is not valid after "Fri 11 Nov 2016 22:20:08 UTC" and a new SPAD file
   should be retrieved before that point in time.

   The following shows a more complex example result for an application
   that uses two flows.  One is TLS to the SIP port of a server with an
   v4 and v6 address.  The TLS connection will have a name of
   example.com in the SNI.  The other flow is media sent over UDP to
   port 5004 on a few different ip addresses.  If devices in the network
   are capable of remarking DSCP, the desired marking is "AF41".

Appendix A.  Contributing

   We welcome all contributions.  Discussion happens in the
   <https://spadwg.slack.com/messages/general/> room in slack and on
   GitHub issue threads at (<https://github.com/fluffy/spad/issues>).
   Changes are done via git pull requests.  For PsR merged into the
   master branch, we strive for rough consensus and we measure that by
   the reviews placed on the PR.

   The Specification style is "less is more".  If a reasonable developer
   who is fully up on modern web development practices could figure out
   how write an interoperable implementation after looking at some
   examples and code and asking a few questions, well that's good enough

   for us.  If you can find it on Wikipedia, we don't need to explain it
   here.

   Markdown is used for text.  RAML and JSON Schema are used to describe
   the API.  Examples are often used as normative specification.  The
   build chain has the goal is to be simple and obvios with no black
   magic.

Appendix B.  Published Versions

   The website at (<https://fluffy.github.io/spad/>) provides an
   overview view of the specification that is focused on developers.
   However all the key information to implement the specification that
   is used to generate the website is also used to generate and internet
   draft that can be found at draft-jennings-dispatch-spad-v0 [1] that
   is slanted at specification developers.  Periodically the information
   on the master is branched to versioned draft branch and published and
   an internet draft.  A typical cadence for this is monthly so that it
   can receiver broader review.  If the PRs that were merged to master
   represent WG rough consensus, it is expected that it the will move
   quickly through the standards process.  When the work is at a good
   point to form a version of the API, it is progressed to an RFC and
   the text of the approved RFC is used to form a released version of
   the spec.  The first version would be v1.  The current working pre
   standard version is always referred to as v0.  The API includes the
   version in the URL so that developers can implement to a specific non
   changing specification.  Future versions attempt, but do not
   guarantee, to be backwards comptable with the previos version.
